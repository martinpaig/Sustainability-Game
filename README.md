Computer Graphics course - Rising Tides

Informative children's game about rising sea levels. Use WASD keys to collect litter pieces before the sea level rises too high.
When collect a certain number of pieces of litter, sea level will increase at a slower pace, or take a jump downwards.

Scope: 3 weeks

Purpose:
Write a computer game or “interactive art work” of your own design.
To learn how to manage a substantial programming project. To experience the challenges of
game design, including game-play, visual design, interaction, and graphics

Requirements:
Uses 2D computer graphics.
Has user interaction (that is, the user must interact with the program which affects
the game in some way, through the mouse or keyboard or both).
Has graphical objects that interact with one another in some way (for example, the
ball interacting with blocks from Assignment 2 Completion).
Has at least two “levels” or some other way to reset the game to a different
configuration. This is to demonstrate a couple of programming skills: (1) that you are
able to reset without having to quit and re-run the program from the start; (2) that
you can separate game play from the graphical objects in such a way that your
program provides the same game play in at least two different situations.
